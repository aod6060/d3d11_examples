# D3D11 Examples

These are a set of examples for me to learn D3D11 examples... These
will basically be built up over the course of each example.

## Blank Window
Very basic example, just setting up window

## Triangle
Drawing a triangle to the window.

## Triangle Color
Demonstrating color blending triangle.

## Triangle Texture
Demonstrating texturing...

## Index Geometry
Demonstrating index drawing...

## Mesh Loading
This demonstrates how the load meshes using assimp using D3D11 api.

## Simple Camera
This is a simple camera system.

## Terrain
This examples show how to render terrain in D3D11. Its quite simple to do,
however, this example doesn't have multi texturing. The next example will 
demonstrate how to do it there...

## Terrain Multi Texture
This example demonstrates how to do multi texture terrain. I'm using a blend
map to render the terrain. I'm using my own textures that turned out ok.
